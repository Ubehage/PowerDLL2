# PowerDLL2

PowerDLL2 is an old grab-bag of VB6 modules, classes and helper routines I wrote and reused over many years.
It started life in the Win9x era, grew a little in the early XP days, and then I stopped working on it in 2005.
The last change I made broke compilation; it will not compile as-is.
The last stable build is included.

**Short version:**
This is a mixed bag.
A few genuinely useful components are buried in a lot of small, rough, pragmatic routines.
A lot of crappy code.

## Status
- Original development: Late 1990s → 2005.
- Platform targeted: VB6, Win9x → Windows XP era.
- Current state: Abandoned since 2005.
- Maintenance: None. Consider this archival code that may contain useful snippets, patterns and working modules — but also messy and deprecated code.

## What’s inside
- A large collection of small routines and helper functions (general utilities, string manipulation, file and path helpers, registry helpers, simple UI helpers, API wrappers, etc.).
- Several classes and modules.
- A few components that may still be considered useful.
- Some deprecated or platform-specific code that will not work on modern Windows without modification.
